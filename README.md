Notebook Folders Description:

EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis: Here we explore how our dataset is divided and its characteristics

Unimodal - This is our Baseline DL models - ResNext and RoBERTa

Embedding-preprocess - Here we have added all the data/embedding preprocessing code (via PCA) and concatenation for our early fusion

WithoutPCA_Models - All the models with original embedding

WithPCA_Models - All the models with PCA based embeddings (T:I - 1:1, 3:1 and 1:3)

Retrain_Roberta - Here we have retrained roberta and ran all the models with the retrained embeddings

Detectors-CIS522-Report: The final report for the project.
